# TODO for Modifying style2.html

- [x] Update CSS for .sub-box to include image styling (width, height, border-radius, margin, border).
- [x] Change CEO, President, and Principals boxes to use .sub-box class instead of .box, and adjust border colors (yellow for CEO and Principals, red for President).
- [x] Rearrange HTML structure: CEO in top level, President and Principals in one row side by side, Other Staff below, then sub-levels.
- [x] Adjust connectors between levels to maintain flow.
- [x] Test the layout and ensure responsiveness.
- [x] Make the layout responsive for mobile, tablet, laptop, TV, and projector screens.
- [x] Add images to each sub-level box.
- [x] Add responsive design for mobile s (small mobile) and mobile m (medium mobile).
